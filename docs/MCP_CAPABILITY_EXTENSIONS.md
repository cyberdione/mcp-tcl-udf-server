# MCP Protocol Extensions for TCL Runtime Capabilities

## Executive Summary

This document describes the comprehensive design and implementation of MCP protocol extensions for the TCL MCP server to communicate runtime capabilities to LLM clients. The solution addresses the critical need for LLMs to understand which TCL interpreter is active, available language features, command safety levels, and operational constraints.

## Problem Statement

LLM clients need detailed information about TCL runtime capabilities to:

1. **Generate appropriate code** that works within the active interpreter's constraints
2. **Avoid generating invalid code** that uses unavailable commands or features
3. **Respect safety boundaries** in restricted vs privileged execution modes
4. **Provide accurate assistance** based on the specific TCL implementation (Molt vs full TCL)
5. **Adapt to runtime limitations** such as missing file I/O or network capabilities

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Enhanced MCP Protocol Structure

The solution extends the standard MCP protocol with TCL-specific capability reporting:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": {},
    "tcl": {
      "runtime": {
        "type": "molt|tcl",
        "version": "0.4.0",
        "name": "Molt TCL Interpreter",
        "implementation": "rust|c",
        "thread_safe": false,
        "memory_safe": true
      },
      "commands": {
        "available": 47,
        "unsafe": ["exec", "file", "socket"],
        "restricted": [],
        "safe": ["string", "list", "expr", "set"]
      },
      "extensions": {
        "custom_tools": true,
        "filesystem_discovery": true,
        "persistence": true
      }
    }
  },
  "serverInfo": {
    "name": "tcl-mcp-server-enhanced",
    "version": "1.1.0",
    "tcl_runtime": "Molt 0.4.0",
    "build_features": ["molt"],
    "safety_mode": "restricted|privileged"
  }
}
```

### 2. New MCP Methods

#### `tcl/capabilities`
Returns comprehensive runtime capability information:

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "type": "molt",
    "version": "0.4.0", 
    "name": "Molt TCL Interpreter",
    "implementation": "rust",
    "thread_safe": false,
    "memory_safe": true
  },
  "features": {
    "core_commands": ["set", "expr", "if", "for"],
    "string_operations": ["string", "append", "format"],
    "list_operations": ["list", "lindex", "llength"],
    "math_operations": ["expr", "incr"],
    "control_structures": ["if", "for", "foreach", "while"],
    "procedures": ["proc", "return", "uplevel"],
    "variables": ["set", "unset", "global"]
  },
  "limitations": {
    "file_io": "No file I/O commands available",
    "network": "No network commands available",
    "exec": "No external process execution",
    "unsafe_commands": "Commands like 'exec', 'open', 'socket' not available"
  },
  "safety": {
    "level": "restricted",
    "sandboxed": true,
    "command_filtering": true,
    "privilege_escalation": false
  },
  "commands": {
    "total_available": 47,
    "safe": ["string", "list", "expr"],
    "restricted": [],
    "unsafe": [],
    "unavailable": ["exec", "open", "file", "socket"]
  }
}
```

#### `tcl/commands`
Returns detailed command information with filtering:

```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "safety": "safe",
      "category": "string",
      "description": "String manipulation operations",
      "subcommands": ["length", "index", "range"],
      "available": true,
      "restrictions": []
    },
    {
      "name": "exec",
      "safety": "unavailable",
      "category": "system",
      "description": "Execute external commands",
      "available": false,
      "reason": "Security restriction in current runtime"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "total": 2,
    "safe": 1,
    "restricted": 0,
    "unsafe": 0,
    "unavailable": 1
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Tool Metadata

Tool descriptions now include runtime context:

```json
{
  "name": "bin___tcl_execute",
  "description": "Execute a TCL script using Molt interpreter (restricted mode)",
  "inputSchema": { ... },
  "metadata": {
    "runtime": "Molt TCL Interpreter",
    "safety_level": "restricted",
    "available_commands": 47,
    "limitations": ["no_file_io", "no_exec", "no_network"]
  }
}
```

## Implementation Components

- Context-aware help and suggestions

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Capability Query
```python
# LLM client checks capabilities before code generation
caps_response = client.send_request("tcl/capabilities")
capabilities = caps_response["result"]

if "string" in capabilities["features"]["string_operations"]:
    # Generate string manipulation code
    code = 'string length "hello"'
else:
    # Provide alternative approach
    code = 'expr {[string length "hello"]}'  # fallback
```

### 2. Safety-Aware Code Generation
```python
# Check safety level before generating system commands
safety_level = capabilities["safety"]["level"]

if safety_level == "privileged":
    # Can suggest file operations
    code = 'set content [read [open "file.txt" r]]'
else:
    # Suggest safe alternatives
    code = 'set content "Use tcl_tool_add to create file reading tools"'
```

### 3. Command Availability Checking
```python
# Query specific command categories
cmd_response = client.send_request("tcl/commands", {"category": "system"})
system_commands = cmd_response["result"]["commands"]

available_system_cmds = [cmd["name"] for cmd in system_commands if cmd["available"]]

if "exec" in available_system_cmds:
    # Generate system command code
    pass
else:
    # Explain limitation and suggest alternatives
    pass
```
